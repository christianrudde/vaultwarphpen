# Contributing

Thank you for helping. Vaultwarphpen has one goal: to behave exactly like the pinned Vaultwarden
version, so that the official Bitwarden clients and existing Vaultwarden data keep working.

## Before you start

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) describes the environment, the commands, the parity workflow and the
  conventions of the code. It applies to people and AI assistants alike.
- [PARITY.md](PARITY.md) shows what is ported and what is still open. Each item names the place in
  Vaultwarden's Rust source it comes from; read that before you implement it.
- For larger changes, open an issue first so that we can agree on the approach.

## Making a change

- Port the behaviour from Vaultwarden's source at the pinned commit; do not invent behaviour of your own.
  Where Vaultwarphpen has to differ, say so in the matrix note and in
  [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
- Write a test for every item you mark as done, and a differential test for every route (see
  AGENTS.md).
- Run Pint, PHPStan and the tests before you open a pull request:

  ```bash
  vendor/bin/pint
  vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=1G
  php artisan test
  ```

- If you copy a file, start from one or reproduce another library's behaviour, credit it in
  [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).
- Security issues do not belong in public issues or pull requests; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
