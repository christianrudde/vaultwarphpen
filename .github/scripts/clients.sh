#
# Starts a server with an empty SQLite database and the web vault behind an
# HTTPS proxy, and runs the tests of tests/Clients against it, which drive the
# official Bitwarden clients: this implementation by default, Vaultwarden when
# its binary is given. A second server of the same kind logs in with SSO.
#
# Usage: clients.sh [--vaultwarden <binary>] [--serve] [playwright arguments...]
# --serve starts the servers and keeps them running, for `npx playwright test`
# by hand (with the environment it prints).
#
# Needs the web vault in WEB_VAULT_FOLDER (php artisan vaultwarden:web-vault) and
# `npm ci` and `npx playwright install chromium` in tests/Clients. PHP is `php`
# unless PHP names another; it also runs the SMTP sink, which keeps the mail the
# servers send for the tests, and the OpenID provider. Ports 8100 to 8105, 8443
# and 8444 must be free, and 8065, where the CLI waits for the end of its SSO login.
