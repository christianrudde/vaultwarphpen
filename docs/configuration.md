# Configuration

Vaultwarphpen takes Vaultwarden's settings, under the same names, with the same defaults and the same
validation. Vaultwarden's documentation therefore applies:

- [`.env.template`](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/0f44744ef86a2a7bea615af1c024044ce5736187/.env.template)
  of the pinned commit lists every setting with its description
- the [Vaultwarden wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki) explains them in depth

This page covers where the settings come from and where Vaultwarphpen differs.

## Where settings come from

Like Vaultwarden, in this order:

1. **Environment variables**, either real ones (set by the web server, PHP-FPM or the shell) or lines
   in `.env`. Real environment variables win over `.env`.
2. **`<NAME>_FILE`** instead of `<NAME>` reads the value from a file, for secrets such as
   `ADMIN_TOKEN_FILE` or `DATABASE_URL_FILE`.
3. **`config.json`** in the data folder (or at `CONFIG_FILE`) overrides the environment. The admin panel
   writes it, in Vaultwarden's format, so either implementation reads what the other saved.
4. **Defaults** for everything not set.

Invalid values and combinations are refused with Vaultwarden's error messages.

## Laravel's settings

The upper part of `.env` belongs to Laravel. Leave it as `.env.example` has it, except:

- `APP_KEY`: created by `php artisan key:generate`
- `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` on a server
- `LOG_CHANNEL` and `LOG_STACK` if you want the log somewhere other than `storage/logs/laravel.log`

Keep the cache, session and queue drivers on `file` and `sync`. Laravel's `DB_*` variables are not
used; the database is configured with Vaultwarden's `DATABASE_URL`.

## Which settings take effect

Every setting is read and validated, but many belong to features that are not ported yet; those have
no effect so far. The `config:` items in [PARITY.md](../PARITY.md) show the state of each one.

## Differences from Vaultwarden

- **Relative paths** (`DATA_FOLDER`, `DATABASE_URL` with SQLite, ...) are relative to the installation
  folder. Vaultwarden takes them relative to its working directory.
- **Rocket's settings** (`ROCKET_ADDRESS`, `ROCKET_PORT`, `ROCKET_TLS` and the other `ROCKET_*`
  variables) do not exist: the web server and PHP take over their jobs. Upload limits are PHP's
  ([Installation](installation.md#php-settings)).
- **The database pool settings** `DATABASE_MAX_CONNS`, `DATABASE_MIN_CONNS`, `DATABASE_IDLE_TIMEOUT`,
  `DATABASE_TIMEOUT` and `DB_CONNECTION_RETRIES` are validated but have no effect: PHP opens one
  connection per request.
- **Logging** goes through Laravel's log (`storage/logs/laravel.log`, or wherever `LOG_CHANNEL` sends
  it), not to standard output. `LOG_LEVEL` takes Vaultwarden's values and sets the level of every
  channel: `trace` and `debug` become Laravel's `debug`, `warn` becomes `warning`, and `off` turns the
  log off. Levels for single modules, as in `info,vaultwarden::api::icons=debug`, are checked like
  Vaultwarden does, but only the first level counts. The lines look like Vaultwarden's
  (`EXTENDED_LOGGING`, `LOG_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`), with `vaultwarphpen` where Vaultwarden names its Rust
  module. `LOG_FILE` adds a file and `USE_SYSLOG` the syslog (as `vaultwarden`, facility user), as in
  Vaultwarden; a file is not reopened on `SIGHUP`, which PHP does not need.
- **Scheduled jobs** run in a process of their own (`php artisan vaultwarden:schedule`) or from cron
  (`--once`), not inside the web server ([Installation](installation.md#scheduled-jobs)).
  `JOB_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` sets how often the process checks; with cron, cron decides, but `0` still
  turns all jobs off.
- **Rate limits** live in Laravel's cache (`storage/framework/cache`) instead of in memory, so all PHP
  workers share them. Vaultwarden keeps them per process.
- **The server's name.** Where Vaultwarden names itself to the clients (the `server` object of
  `/api/config`), Vaultwarphpen names itself and links to its own repository, so that users find the
  source of the server they use and report problems in the right place.
- **SSO** works like Vaultwarden's, with two gaps: ID tokens signed with RSA-PSS (`PS256` and the
  like) are refused, where Vaultwarden accepts them, and `SSO_DEBUG_TOKENS` logs nothing. The
  discovered provider is cached for `SSO_CLIENT_CACHE_EXPIRATION` seconds in Laravel's cache, so all
  PHP workers share it.
- **The admin diagnostics** name Vaultwarphpen, with the Vaultwarden release it follows, and look for
  newer versions in Vaultwarphpen's repository (its latest release, or the latest commit for an
  installation from a branch). The installed version is what Composer recorded when it last installed
  the checkout, so run `composer install` after updating. The page shows PHP's version and server API
  where Vaultwarden shows Rust's runtime.
- **Settings take effect at once.** Vaultwarden reads `config.json` when it starts and when its admin
  panel saves; PHP reads the configuration for every request. Setting or removing `ADMIN_TOKEN` in
  `config.json` therefore opens or closes the admin panel right away, where Vaultwarden needs a restart.
- **Development routes.** Vaultwarden's debug builds serve static files from the source tree at
  `/vw_static/`; release builds do not, and neither does Vaultwarphpen.
- **Caches.** Do not cache Laravel's configuration or routes (see
  [Installation](installation.md#things-not-to-do)).
